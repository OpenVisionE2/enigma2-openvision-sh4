Enigma2 Kernel Module
=====================

This module is a replacement for all exisiting hardware checks, it replaces 
boxbranding, enigma2 internal methods like getBoxType().  This feature is 
implemented via SystemInfo.  This is intended to be a single entry point 
for accessing and managing all hardware and system data.

This data is accessed and managed via the BoxInfo class within SystemInfo.py. 
Unlike the SystemInfo dictionary the data is contained and isolated within 
the SystemInfo module.  There is no need to export or share the dictionary 
across Enigma2 modules.

Enigma2 internal calls needs enigma2 to work first so can't be used outside it and boxbranding works if you import it so not a good solution for shell scripts and anything other than python.

Enigma2 kernel module is a pre-compiled .ko file which contains needed information about hardware features, as it's a compiled file it's secure and can't be changed later.

The module creates so many proc files which could be read with any language and in case of any failiure or multiboot situation we read the module description instead of relying on the proc files so "modinfo -d" will help us.

Current enigma2 reads the module via SystemInfo.py and current proc path is "/proc/openvision" and the module name is "openvision.ko" which could be changed if all teams agree on something.

OV's boxbranding is different although it's based on OE-A's sources but has some extra calls and some removed, also we have different names in OV, as the module is a replacement for boxbranding also we tried to have similar names but lets see what replaces what:

/proc/openvision/model replaces getBoxType (getMachineName and getMachineMake in OE-A's boxbranding)
/proc/openvision/brand replaces getBoxBrand (getMachineBrand and getBrandOEM in OE-A's boxbranding)

* Replacement for getMachineProcModel is getBoxProc in StbHardware.py
* Replacement for OE-A's boxbranding getDriverDate is getDriverInstalledDate in About.py (Components)
* Replacement for OE-A's boxbranding getHaveMiniTV is LCDMiniTV in SystemInfo.py
* We don't have anything for OE-A's boxbranding getHaveSCARTYUV and we manage it via if conditions in VideoHardware.py

Time to explain each one and give examples (all proc files and modinfo data are immutable):

model:
	BoxInfo.getItem("model") (/proc/openvision/model)

	This variable defines the receiver model in OE sources.
	Real model could be a different thing in real life and this
	is only what kernel defconfig shows as hostname.

	Example: h9

brand:
	BoxInfo.getItem("brand") (/proc/openvision/brand)

	This variable defines the receiver brand or the meta name in OE sources.
	Real brand could be a different thing in real life, also
	not all the times it's the brand name but sometimes it's the meta name so
	it's related to OE sources.

	Example: airdigital

platform:
	BoxInfo.getItem("platform") (/proc/openvision/platform)

	This variable defines the receiver platform in OE sources.
	This is not a real thing, it's what developers call a family of similar hardwares.
	Instead of checking models one by one we could assing something to a family and reduce the checks.
	If a model does not belong to a family the platform will be same as model so model and platform
	are equal in some receivers.

	Example: zgemmahisi3798mv200

visionversion:
	BoxInfo.getItem("visionversion") (/proc/openvision/visionversion)

	This variable defines the main OV version which only changes when GCC changes or
	when other important packages like python get updated.

	Example: master

oe:
	BoxInfo.getItem("oe") (/proc/openvision/oe)

	This variable defines the OE branch.
	If it's anything other than "master" means it's fixed on a specific branch like pyro and
